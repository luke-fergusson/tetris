<h1><b>A-level project.</b></h1>
<p> 
  During my A-level computer science, I recreated Tetris and created a heuristic AI to play the game, using concepts of inheritance and composition.

  Entirely made in C#.

  Key takeaways: many of the subroutines are inefficient and could be simplified, and the importance of writing clean and managable code.
